        - parameters:
            - sourceFileURL: The source file to create the GIF from.
            - destinationFileURL: An optional destination file to write the GIF to. If you don't include this, a default path will be provided.
            - frameCount: The number of frames to include in the gif; each frame has the same duration and is spaced evenly over the video.
            - delayTime: The amount of time each frame exists for in the GIF.
            - loopCount: The number of times the GIF will repeat. This defaults to `0`, which means that the GIF will repeat infinitely.
            - completion: A block that will be called when the GIF creation is completed. The `result` parameter provides the path to the file, or will be `nil` if there was an error.
